By leveraging these insights, the coffee shop can optimize its operations, marketing strategies and product offerings to enhance overall business performance and customer satisfaction.

1. A peak in sales is observed each day between 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.Thus, the shop should consider running targeted promotions such as "Morning Rush Discounts" or "Happy Hour" specials during these hours to further boost sales.Moreover,it should ensure adequate staffing during these peak hours to manage the increased customer flow efficiently and enhance customer service experience.

2. The total sales revenue is increasing each month from Jan 2023 to June 2023.This steady increase in monthly sales revenue indicates positive business growth and a plan for capacity adjustments, such as stocking more inventory or enhancing store infrastructure should be made

3. The total sales by revenue is approximately same for different store locations, suggesting consistent customer experience and operational efficiency.However, the shop should develop marketing strategies to the specific demographics and preferences of each store's local customer base to further optimize sales.

4. Average order per person is quite low and strategies such as creating bundled offers that encourage customers to purchase more items per visit, increasing the average order value, should be executed.

5. There is a large percentage of distribution of coffee and tea.The shop should also offer workshops or tastings that educate customers about different types of coffee and tea, enhancing their experience and potentially increasing sales of premium products.
